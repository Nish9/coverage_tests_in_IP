# coverage_tests_in_IP
As a user of the GMS interpretation portal I want to know the sequence coverage all green genes in the version of the panel applied to my case so that I can be confident I have not missed any potential causal variants in my case. Coverage data should exclude non-green genes from the panel.
This is a small script that can be run to compare the gene list in gene panel coverage from CIP-API with the gene list from panelapp API for the specific version of the panel applied limited to entity type = gene and confidence level is 3
